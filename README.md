A 2048-style game based on the CS major here at binghamton! Progress through the major, combining the class blocks to create new ones, ultimately working towards the end tile!

There are two modes to the game: easy mode (11 tiles, just like regular 2048), or a harder version with 2 more tiles to work through to win!
